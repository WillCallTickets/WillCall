*** START FROM NOW *** WORK BACKWARDS ***
- galvanize to modernize my skills and strengthen resume - fresh out of school with a new set of tools
- have recently worked in QA, while not certain that QA is where my heart is, I am confirmed that tech industry is where my passion is
- from running my own consulting business and touring the country doing audio
    - grew tired of the travel and time away from home
    - not focusing on consulting full time led me to not acquire new tech as quickly as I wanted to
     and I felt behind the times. Limited community to learn from
- I desire community and galvanize was a step towards this goal


*** WEAKNESSES ***
- I tend to give the long answer where only the short answer is needed
    - I have been identifying this and am improving
- More or less terrified of public speaking
    - slowly getting better - finding the only way to improve is by practice - which is still terrifying
- Not taking enough time for myself
    - this is somewhat born out of running my own business, I felt obligated to my clients and
        to the business itself to finish tasks at hand and not let them sit unfinished
- Trying to do everything myself
    - need to identify existing solutions and apply them to my use cases

*** WHY HIRE ME ***
- I tend to think outside of the box
    - examples!!!!
    - talking to the NASA guys about the ice on the boosters - and suggested they have the maintenance staff
        knock off the ice and they essentially (at least they told me that that is what they essentially
        ended up doing) - so now I am a rocket scientist
- I am hard to impress - experienced enough to know better
    - ability to think through the problem and identify potential risks
    - Sagacity definition, acuteness of mental discernment and soundness of judgment
- ability to read a demographic - sense of service and ability to present a business presence
    - not only thinking of my job, but the presence of the business and how promoting the brand
        positivity is a reward within itself
- strive for perfection - I was never satisfied - always trying to improve my skills
    - consider this as a weakness as well.
